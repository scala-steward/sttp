brave backend
=============

To use, add the following dependency to your project::

  "com.softwaremill.sttp" %% "brave-backend" % "1.7.2"

This backend depends on `brave <https://github.com/openzipkin/brave>`_, a distributed tracing implementation compatible with Zipkin backend services.

The brave backend wraps any other backend, and needs an instance of brave's ``HttpTracing`` or ``Tracing``, for example::

  val httpTracing: HttpTracing = ...
  implicit val sttpBackend = BraveBackend(AkkaHttpBackend(), httpTracing)

The backend obtains the current trace context using default Brave's propagation mechanisms. As it's often challenging to integrate context propagation in an asynchronous setting, there's also a possibility to add the trace context to the request's tags::

  import com.softwaremill.sttp.brave.BraveBackend._

  val parent: TraceContext = ...

  sttp
    .get(...)
    .tagWithTraceContext(parent))
